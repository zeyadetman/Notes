# Home Workout Plan

I created this sheet to organize and track my daily workouts at home for 12 weeks, It made a difference to me and I really recommend it to you if you're working from home or you want to do exercises at home and you don't have a plan, Here's the plan :smile:

Just clone it and change the dates based on your start date. As well as change the exercises cells colors and customize it to your preferences. I was using **green for completed,** **yellow for rest days,** **red for missing days,** and **purple for rest replaced by workouts.**
