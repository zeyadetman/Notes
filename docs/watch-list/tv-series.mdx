# TV Series <RiMovieLine />

In this document, I'll share with you my tv series watch list, I'd rather [watching movies](movies) than TV shows, it's like spending two hours - more or less - and
you're done, but with TV shows, you have to spend a lot of time to watch a season, and you have to wait for the next season to be released, and if you missed a tv show 4 seasons for example,
you have to watch all of them to understand what's going on, and that's why I don't like TV shows, but I'm trying to watch some of them, and I'll share with you my watch list.

Also you can recommend me some TV shows to watch, I'll be happy to watch them.
