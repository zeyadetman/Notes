# Video Games <CgGames />

This is a list of video games I've played and enjoyed.

My favorite games series is actually the **GTA** series, I've worked all of its chapters and I'm a big fan of [GTA San Andreas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383385/reference/), I spent about 6 months playing its story
with [Carl Johnson](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Johnson).

The most greatest story I've ever played is [Red Dead Redemption II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6161168/reference/), It's super great and I've played it for about 4 months, It's really a masterpiece.
