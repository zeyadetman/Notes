# Welcome to my notes

Hi, This is my [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) built using the awesome project [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/).

## About me
I'm Zeyad a software engineer from [Egypt 🇪🇬](). Currently I spend most of my time learning and coding.

## About this site
I created this site to track the things that might be useful to be shared with you, It's not like [my blog](https://zeyadetman.com), the blog is more specific for articles I write, but here you'll find my favs and notes 📝.
