- If we need to build a page like bing (the Microsoft search site), what’s your imagination to create the search input and load the results in frontend. We can ask for accessibility because page like this have to be accessible to all users whatever their preferences, how to load the results faster, images faster, caching, doing the api calls, the autocomplete of the input, …etc.
