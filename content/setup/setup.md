I have some previous experiments about [note-taking](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoteTaking) and building your custom website to share these notes with public, I think this happened because of the mix of my career as a [[frontend]] engineer in this time and being curious about gaining knowledge and trying different things.

The first note-taking I've used is [evernote](https://evernote.com/), I used it to keep track of my tasks in the college in around 2016, this was a great app for keep track of tasks, assignments, lectures I want to study, lectures I missed
