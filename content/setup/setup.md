I have some previous experiments about [note-taking](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoteTaking) and building your custom website to share these notes with public, I think this happened because of the mix of my career as a [[frontend]] engineer in this time and being curious about gaining knowledge and trying different things.

The first note-taking I've used is [evernote](https://evernote.com/), I used it to keep track of my tasks in the college in around 2016, this was a great app for keep track of tasks, assignments, lectures I want to study, lectures I missed. but all of the notes in this time was private and specific to my life, so in that case evernote was suitable for this basic usage, and it was free in multiple devices.

After that I tried different apps to take notes and tracking things, Until I settle on this setup.
